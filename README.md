## PROJECT #1 PWNLISTS

Pwnlists - a game collection web application where users can sign up for an account and create their own video game lists. Pwnlists encourages users to be creative with their lists and really tests gamers on how much they know about the games they know and love.

## How to use
* Sign up or log in via the homepage.
* Create your gamer profile
* Add games to the database including an image
* Create lists of your favourites games
* View and edit all games currently in the database
* View and edit all lists created by users

## Objectives
* app should have at least 3 models. Currently Users, Games and Lists.
* Use partials to DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) up your views.
* Handles invalid data. Forms in your application should validate data and handle incorrect inputs. Validate sign up information, verify valid email addresses and secure passwords.
* Use Gems Use a GEM that talks to an API to add functionality to your app.
* User Login Make sure you have basic authentication and authorization set up (if you need it).
* Heroku. Deploy your code to Heroku.

## Challenge Add-ons
These were not covered in class but were added to my project.

* Front-end Framework - I've chosen to use Bootstrap.
* File upload. I've added Cloudinary for image uploads.
* **Web Scraping.** Check out Nokogiri.


## Scope
* **Scope.** What are you planning to build? What features will it have? What do
you reasonably think you can implement in the time period?
* **Object Models.** Draw out the model associations for your project.
* **Wireframes.** Sketch out what a few of your core pages will look like and
how they will work. Paper works great. You can also check out wireframing
software like Gliffy or Omnigraffle.
* **Milestones.** Outline some milestones for yourself based on how you prefer
to work.
* **Readme.md** Projects need a readme file in markdown explaining their project: a how and why of what you wanted to solve, how you built, problems, tech used.

#### Completed Project deliverables:

* Link to Heroku hosted project
* Link to source code on GitHub


## Things to keep in mind
Make sure that your code is:

* In it the proper places. Logic in views? Fat controllers?
* Is it DRY? Can I reuse parts of this project's code?
* Well-commented. Will we understand what is going on in your controllers?
* Well-formatted. Make it pretty.
* Adheres to a styleguide.

We’ll also be looking at:

* Quality of communication around decision-making. Can you defend why you chose
a certain technology or why you implemented your solution in a certain way?
* Your ability to pick up new technologies and push yourself.
