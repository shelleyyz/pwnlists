## PROJECT #1 PWNLISTS

Pwnlists - a game collection web application where users can sign up for an account and create their own video game lists. The website encourages users to be creative with their lists and really tests gamers on how much they know about the games they love.

## How to use
* Sign up or log in via the homepage.
* Once signed in, you can then create your gamer profile and update your your details example

- email
- password
- first name
- last name
- bio
- country or location
- avatar

* Users can then create gaming lists
* **Models.** Your app should have at least 3 models. Make sure they are
associated correctly!
* **Views.** Use partials to DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) up your views.
* **Handles invalid data.** Forms in your application should validate data and
handle incorrect inputs. Validate sign up information, verify valid email
addresses and secure passwords.
* **Use Gems** Use a GEM that talks to an API to add functionality to your app.
* **User Login.** Make sure you have basic authentication and authorization set up (if you need it).
* **Heroku.** Deploy your code to Heroku.

## CHALLENGE ADD-ONS
We may not have covered all of these in class, but if you want to push yourself
and learn something new, optionally consider doing some of the following with
your app.

* **Front-end Framework.** Use either Twitter Bootstrap or Foundation to kick start your front-end.
* **File upload.** Take a look at Cloudinary.
* **Web Scraping.** Check out Nokogiri.


## PLANNING & DELIVERABLES

#### Project Plan deliverables:

* **Scope.** What are you planning to build? What features will it have? What do
you reasonably think you can implement in the time period?
* **Object Models.** Draw out the model associations for your project.
* **Wireframes.** Sketch out what a few of your core pages will look like and
how they will work. Paper works great. You can also check out wireframing
software like Gliffy or Omnigraffle.
* **Milestones.** Outline some milestones for yourself based on how you prefer
to work.
* **Readme.md** Projects need a readme file in markdown explaining their project: a how and why of what you wanted to solve, how you built, problems, tech used.

#### Completed Project deliverables:

* Link to Heroku hosted project
* Link to source code on GitHub


## Things to keep in mind
Make sure that your code is:

* In it the proper places. Logic in views? Fat controllers?
* Is it DRY? Can I reuse parts of this project's code?
* Well-commented. Will we understand what is going on in your controllers?
* Well-formatted. Make it pretty.
* Adheres to a styleguide.

We’ll also be looking at:

* Quality of communication around decision-making. Can you defend why you chose
a certain technology or why you implemented your solution in a certain way?
* Your ability to pick up new technologies and push yourself.
